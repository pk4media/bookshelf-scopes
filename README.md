Giving you Rails like scopes in Bookshelf.js.

If you add in the plugin like so:
```javascript
var bookshelf = require('bookshelf')(knex);

bookshelf.plugin(require('bookshelf-scopes'));
```

You will then be able to add a scopes property on your models that will give you
a Knex query builder as the first argument and then followed by any additional
arguments. See examples below.

Also just like rails we can set a default. See examples below.

## Examples

### Simple

You can define a model with scopes and an active function like this:
```javascript
var TestModel = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'testmodel',
  scopes: {
    active: function(qb) {
      qb.where({status: 'Active'});
    },
    nameContains: function(qb, name) {
      qb.where(knex.raw('name LIKE ?', '%' + name + '%'));
    }
  }
});
```
You can now run code like this to get all Active:
```javascript
TestModel.active().fetchAll().then(function(allActiveTests) {
  ...
});
```
You can also get all active where name contains test as well:
```javascript
TestModel.active().nameContains('test').fetchAll().then(function(allActiveTests) {
  ...
});
```

### Default

You can define a model with scopes and default like this:
```javascript
var TestModel = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'testmodel',
  scopes: {
    default: function(qb) {
      qb.where({archived: 0});
    }
  }
});
```
Now if you call fetchAll or fetch on any of your queries you will only get items that have archive set to 0:
```javascript
TestModel.fetchAll().then(function(allUnArchived) {
  ...
});
```

If you need to query without the default scope you can call unscoped like so:
```javascript
TestModel.unscoped().fetchAll().then(function(allModels) {
  ...
});
```

### Combine Methods In Scope

You can define a bunch of scope functions you can also combine them in another scope function.
```javascript
var TestModel = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'testmodel',
  scopes: {
    running: function(qb) {
      qb.where({running: 0});
    },
    byDate: function(qb, date) {
      qb.where('created_date', '>=', date);
    },
    runningByDate: function(qb, date) {
      this.running(qb);
      this.byDate(qb, date);
    }
  }
});
```
Now you can use the combined scope method as well to make things more readable.
```javascript
TestModel.runningByDate('2015-01-01').fetchAll().then(function(allUnArchived) {
  ...
});
```

### Scopes on Relationships

You can also use scopes in the relationships as well. So you could have a model
like this:

```javascript
var TestModel = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'testmodel',
  scopes: {
    active: function(qb) {
      qb.where('active', '=', true);
    }
  }
});
```
And then you can have a model that has many active models above as children like so:

```javascript
var MyModel = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'mymodel',
  active_test_models: function() {
    return this.hasMany(TestModel1).active();
  }
});
```

### Override Initialize

If in your model you set an initialize you will need to call addScope() to add default scope if you want it

```javascript
var TestModel = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'testmodel',
  scopes: {
    default: function(qb) {
      qb.where({status: 'Active'});
    }
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.addScope(); //Now default scope is set, all other scopes work regardless.
    this.newValue = 1;
  }
});
```

Then calls to fetchAll will include it.
```javascript
TestModel.fetchAll().then(function(allActive) {
  ...
});
```
